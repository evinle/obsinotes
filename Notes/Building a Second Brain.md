## CODE method
### Capture
- Capture what resonates
- “Turn up the volume on your intuition so we can hear the wisdom it offers us” 

### Organise
- Dewey decimal system? 
- Organise based on what action can be done with them

### Distill
- Think of yourself not as a taker of note, but a giver!! 
	- Haha
	- Also very similar idea can and should be adopted for coding
	
### Express
- “PKM exists to support taking action, everything else is a distraction” ? 
- Information vs knowledge
- “Since nothing is ever truly final, there is no need to wait to get started”
