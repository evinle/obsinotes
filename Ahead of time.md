Let’s think a week ahead, the consequences of my actions today
Feels like I’m always rushing without thinking these days, not just sleep but my attention and foresight is also deprived
Even a simple out of office status, and rejecting of meetings in rsvps, or a lunch out. 
It’s because I don’t have a system for looking ahead, too many calendars
